# *PyGenStability*

This ``python`` package is designed for multiscale community detection with Markov Stability (MS) analysis [1, 2] and allows researchers to identify robust network partitions at different resolutions. It implements several variants of the MS cost functions that are based on graph diffusion processes to explore the network (see illustration below). Whilst primarily built for MS, the internal architecture of *PyGenStability* has been designed to solve for a wide range of clustering cost functions since it is based on optimising the so-called generalized Markov Stability function [3]. To maximize the generalized Markov Stability cost function, *PyGenStability* provides a convenient ``python`` interface for ``C++`` implementations of Louvain [4] and Leiden [5] algorithms.
We further provide specific analysis tools to process and analyse the results from multiscale community detection, and to facilitate the automatic selection of robust partitions [6]. *PyGenStability* is accompanied by a software paper that further details the implementation, result analysis, benchmarks and applications [7].

## Documentation

A documentation of all features of the *PyGenStability* is available here: https://barahona-research-group.github.io/PyGenStability/, or in pdf [here](pygenstability_doc.pdf).

## Installation


The wrapper uses Pybind11 https://github.com/pybind/pybind11 and the package can simply be installed by first cloning this repo with

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/PyGenStability.git
```

(if the `--recurse-submodules` has not been used, just do `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch the submodule with M. Schaub's code). 

Then, to install the package, simply run
```
pip install . 
```
using a fresh `virtualenv` in python3 may be recommended to avoid conflict of python packages. 

To use plotly for interactive plots in the browser, install this package with 
```
pip install .[plotly]
```

To use a contrib module, with additional tools, run
```
pip install .[contrib]
```

To install all dependencies, run
```
pip install .[all]
```

## Using the code

The code is simple to run with the default settings. We can input our graph (of type scipy.csgraph), run a scan in scales with a chosen Markov Stability constructor and plot the results in a summary figure presenting different partition quality measures across scales (values of MS cost function, number of communities, etc.) with an indication of optimal scales.

```
import pygenstability as pgs
results = pgs.run(graph)
pgs.plot_scan(results)
```

Although it is enforced in the code, it is advised to set environment variables
```
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS=1
```
to ensure numpy does not use multi-threadings, which may clash with the parallelisation and slow down the computation. 

There are a variety of further choices that users can make that will impact the partitioning, including:
- Constructor: Generalized Markov Stability requires the user to input a quality matrix and associated null models. We provide an object-oriented module to write user-defined constructors for these objects, with several already implemented (see `pygenstability/constructors.py` for some classic examples).
- Generalized Markov Stability maximizers: To maximize the NP-hard optimal generalized Markov Stability we interface with two algorithms: (i) Louvain and (ii) Leiden.

While Louvain is defined as the default due to its familiarity within the research community, Leiden is known to produce better partitions and can be used by specifying the run function.

```
results = pgs.run(graph, method="leiden")
```

There are also additional post-processing and analysis functions, including:
- Plotting via matplotlib and plotly (interactive).
- Automated optimal scale selection.

Optimal scale selection [6] is performed by default with the run function but can be repeated with different parameters if needed, see `pygenstability/optimal_scales.py`. To reduce noise, e.g., one can increase the parameter values for `block_size` and `window_size`. The optimal network partitions can then be plotted given a NetworkX nx_graph.

```
results = pgs.identify_optimal_scales(results, block_size=10, window_size=5)
pgs.plot_optimal_partitions(nx_graph, results)
```

## Constructors
 
We provide an object-oriented module for constructing quality matrices and null models in `pygenstability/constructors.py`. Various constructors are implemented for different types of graphs:

- `linearized` based on linearized MS for large undirected weighted graphs [2]
- `continuous_combinatorial` based on combinatorial Laplacian for undirected weighted graphs [2]
- `continuous_normalized` based on random-walk normalized Laplacians for undirected weighted graphs [2]
- `signed_modularity` based on signed modularity for large signed graphs [8]
- `signed_combinatorial` based on signed combinatorial Laplacian for signed graphs [3]
- `directed` based on random-walk Laplacian with teleportation for directed weighted graphs [2]
- `linearized_directed` based on random-walk Laplacian with teleportation for large directed weighted graphs

For the computationally efficient analysis of **large** graphs, we recommend using the `linearized`, `linearized_directed` or `signed_modularity` constructors instead of `continuous_combinatorial`, `continuous_normalized`, `directed` or `signed_combinatorial` that rely on the computation of matrix exponentials.

For those of you that wish to implement their own constructor, you will need to design a function with the following properties:

- take a scipy.csgraph `graph` and a float `time` as argument
- return a `quality_matrix` (sparse scipy matrix) and a `null_model` (multiples of two, in a numpy array)
